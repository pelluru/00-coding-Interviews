SELECT * FROM emp_json ORDER BY id LIMIT 5;
-- Expected: JSONB per employee

-- 44) LATERAL JSON expansion using jsonb_to_recordset
WITH sample AS (
  SELECT '[{"p":"Laptop Pro","qty":2},{"p":"Phone X","qty":1}]'::jsonb AS js
)
SELECT x.p, x.qty
FROM sample s,
LATERAL jsonb_to_recordset(s.js) AS x(p text, qty int);
-- Expected: rows: (Laptop Pro,2), (Phone X,1)

-- 45) Arrays + UNNEST with CTE
WITH arrs AS (
  SELECT ARRAY['NY','CA','TX'] AS states
)
SELECT unnest(states) AS state FROM arrs;
-- Expected: NY, CA, TX

-- 46) Parameterizable CTE pattern using constants CTE
WITH params AS (
  SELECT 120000::numeric AS cutoff
)
SELECT e.name, e.salary
FROM employees e, params p
WHERE e.salary >= p.cutoff
ORDER BY salary DESC;
-- Expected: employees with salary >= 120k

-- 47) Distinct-on trick via CTE (latest sale per employee)
WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT s.*, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY sale_date DESC, id DESC) rn
  FROM sales s
)
SELECT emp_id, sale_date, amount
FROM ordered WHERE rn=1
ORDER BY emp_id;
-- Expected: each employee's most recent sale

-- 48) Anti-join via CTE (employees with no sales)
WITH sellers AS (SELECT DISTINCT emp_id FROM sales)
SELECT e.id, e.name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN sellers s ON s.emp_id = e.id
WHERE s.emp_id IS NULL
ORDER BY e.id;
-- Expected: employees who never appear in sales

-- 49) Semi-join via CTE (departments that have at least one sale)
WITH depts_with_sales AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT e.dept_id FROM sales s JOIN employees e ON e.id = s.emp_id
)
SELECT d.id, d.name
FROM departments d
JOIN depts_with_sales ds ON ds.dept_id = d.id
ORDER BY d.id;
-- Expected: subset of departments that have sales activity

-- 50) Multi-level CTE combining ranking, JSON, and filters
WITH totals AS (
  SELECT e.dept_id, e.name, COALESCE(SUM(s.amount),0) AS total
  FROM employees e LEFT JOIN sales s ON s.emp_id = e.id
  GROUP BY e.dept_id, e.name
), ranked AS (
  SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY total DESC) AS rnk
  FROM totals
), top3 AS (
  SELECT dept_id, name, total FROM ranked WHERE rnk <= 3
), packed AS (
  SELECT dept_id, json_agg(json_build_object('name',name,'total',total) ORDER BY total DESC) AS top3
  FROM top3 GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT d.name AS department, p.top3
FROM departments d LEFT JOIN packed p ON p.dept_id = d.id
ORDER BY department;
-- Expected: top-3 performers packaged as JSON per department
