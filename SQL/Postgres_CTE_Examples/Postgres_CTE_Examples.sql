-- =====================================================================
-- 20 CTE EXAMPLES (with heavy comments and expected outputs)
-- Note: Expected outputs are illustrative; exact row order may vary.
-- =====================================================================

-- 1) SIMPLE CTE: Rename/clarify a base selection
WITH ny_depts AS (
  SELECT id, name
  FROM departments
  WHERE location = 'NY'
)
SELECT * FROM ny_depts;
-- Expected output (columns: id, name)
-- 1 | Engineering
-- 2 | Sales

-- 2) MULTIPLE CTEs: Compose results then join
WITH eng AS (
  SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Engineering'
), eng_emps AS (
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.salary
  FROM employees e
  JOIN eng ON e.dept_id = eng.id
)
SELECT * FROM eng_emps ORDER BY salary DESC;
-- Expected (id, name, salary): Alice, Bob, Carol

-- 3) CTE + WHERE filter
WITH high_paid AS (
  SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary >= 120000
)
SELECT name, salary FROM high_paid ORDER BY salary DESC;
-- Expected: Alice 150k, Dave 140k, Grace 130k, Ivan 125k, Bob 120k

-- 4) CTE + JOIN inside the CTE
WITH emp_with_dept AS (
  SELECT e.id, e.name, d.name AS dept, e.salary
  FROM employees e
  JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
)
SELECT * FROM emp_with_dept WHERE dept = 'Sales' ORDER BY salary DESC;
-- Expected: Dave, Eve, Frank (with Sales as dept)

-- 5) CTE + AGGREGATION
WITH dept_avg AS (
  SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT d.name, ROUND(avg_salary,2) AS avg_salary
FROM dept_avg a JOIN departments d ON d.id = a.dept_id
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
-- Expected top ~ Engineering/Sales/Marketing/Finance in some order

-- 6) REUSE THE SAME CTE MULTIPLE TIMES
WITH dept_sales AS (
  SELECT d.id AS dept_id, d.name AS dept_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales s
  JOIN employees e ON e.id = s.emp_id
  JOIN departments d ON d.id = e.dept_id
  GROUP BY d.id, d.name
)
SELECT * FROM dept_sales WHERE total_sales > 3000
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM dept_sales WHERE total_sales <= 3000;
-- Expected: All departments with their total sales split by threshold

-- 7) NESTED CTEs
WITH base AS (
  SELECT e.id, e.name, d.name AS dept, e.salary
  FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON d.id = e.dept_id
), filtered AS (
  SELECT * FROM base WHERE salary >= 100000
)
SELECT dept, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM filtered GROUP BY dept ORDER BY cnt DESC;
-- Expected counts per dept of employees earning >= 100k

-- 8) CTE + CASE logic
WITH sales_enriched AS (
  SELECT s.*, 
         CASE 
           WHEN amount >= 1600 THEN 'High'
           WHEN amount >= 800  THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
         END AS amount_band
  FROM sales s
)
SELECT amount_band, COUNT(*) AS orders
FROM sales_enriched
GROUP BY amount_band
ORDER BY orders DESC;
-- Expected buckets: High/Medium/Low with counts

-- 9) CTE for ranking top-N per department (window fn)
WITH dept_totals AS (
  SELECT d.name AS dept_name, e.id AS emp_id, e.name AS emp_name,
         SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
  FROM employees e
  JOIN departments d ON d.id = e.dept_id
  LEFT JOIN sales s ON s.emp_id = e.id
  GROUP BY d.name, e.id, e.name
), ranked AS (
  SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_name ORDER BY total_sales DESC NULLS LAST) AS rnk
  FROM dept_totals
)
SELECT dept_name, emp_name, total_sales
FROM ranked
WHERE rnk <= 2
ORDER BY dept_name, rnk;
-- Expected: top 2 sellers per department (NULL totals appear last)

-- 10) RECURSIVE CTE: generate numbers 1..10
WITH RECURSIVE nums(n) AS (
  SELECT 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM nums WHERE n < 10
)
SELECT * FROM nums;
-- Expected: rows 1..10

-- 11) RECURSIVE HIERARCHY: employee â†’ manager chain for Bob
WITH RECURSIVE chain AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 0 AS lvl FROM employees WHERE name = 'Bob'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, c.lvl + 1
  FROM employees e 
  JOIN chain c ON e.id = c.manager_id
)
SELECT name, lvl FROM chain ORDER BY lvl;
-- Expected:
-- Bob (0), Alice (1)

-- 12) RECURSIVE PARENT-CHILD AGGREGATION: reports under a manager
WITH RECURSIVE subtree AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, dept_id, salary FROM employees WHERE name = 'Dave'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.* FROM employees e
  JOIN subtree s ON e.manager_id = s.id
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_size, SUM(salary) AS payroll FROM subtree;
-- Expected: team_size=3 (Dave,Eve,Frank), payroll sum

-- 13) WINDOW FN via CTE: running totals by date
WITH daily AS (
  SELECT sale_date, SUM(amount) AS day_total
  FROM sales GROUP BY sale_date
), running AS (
  SELECT sale_date, day_total,
         SUM(day_total) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total
  FROM daily
)
SELECT * FROM running ORDER BY sale_date;
-- Expected: chronological daily totals and cumulative running total

-- 14) CTE + UNION to combine sets
WITH hw AS (SELECT id, name, 'Hardware' AS k FROM products WHERE category='Hardware'),
     svc AS (SELECT id, name, 'Service'  AS k FROM products WHERE category='Service')
SELECT * FROM hw
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM svc
ORDER BY k, name;
-- Expected: all products with a type tag, hardware first, then service

-- 15) CTE FEEDING INSERT
WITH big_orders AS (
  SELECT emp_id, SUM(amount) AS total
  FROM sales GROUP BY emp_id HAVING SUM(amount) >= 3000
)
-- Create a small table to store awards (for example purposes)
, _mk AS (
  SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) t
)
-- The table may not exist on first run; create it if missing:
-- (For idempotency in a single script, use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)
SELECT 1;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS emp_awards (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  remarks TEXT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO emp_awards (emp_id, remarks)
SELECT emp_id, 'Top seller award' FROM big_orders
ON CONFLICT (emp_id) DO NOTHING;
-- Expected: rows inserted for employees whose total sales >= 3000

-- 16) CTE FEEDING UPDATE
WITH raises AS (
  SELECT id, CASE WHEN salary < 100000 THEN salary * 1.05 ELSE salary END AS new_salary
  FROM employees
)
UPDATE employees e
SET salary = r.new_salary
FROM raises r
WHERE e.id = r.id AND e.salary <> r.new_salary;
-- Expected: employees under 100k receive 5% raise

-- 17) CTE FEEDING DELETE
WITH small_products AS (
  SELECT id FROM products WHERE price < 350
)
DELETE FROM products p
USING small_products s
WHERE p.id = s.id;
-- Expected: products below $350 deleted (e.g., Support Plan at 299), adjust as desired

-- 18) MATERIALIZED CTE (Postgres 12+): encourage reuse caching
WITH MATERIALIZED dept_sums AS (
  SELECT d.id, SUM(s.amount) AS total
  FROM departments d
  JOIN employees e ON e.dept_id = d.id
  LEFT JOIN sales s ON s.emp_id = e.id
  GROUP BY d.id
)
SELECT * FROM dept_sums ORDER BY total DESC NULLS LAST;
-- Expected: totals per department, computed once due to MATERIALIZED

-- 19) CTE WITH JSON AGGREGATION
WITH dept_emp AS (
  SELECT d.name AS dept, json_agg(e.name ORDER BY e.name) AS employees
  FROM departments d
  LEFT JOIN employees e ON e.dept_id = d.id
  GROUP BY d.name

SELECT dept, employees FROM dept_emp ORDER BY dept;
-- Expected: one row per department with JSON array of employee names

-- 20) COMPLEX BUSINESS QUERY:
-- Goal: For each department, show:
--  - total sales,
--  - top-selling employee (by sales),
--  - count of active projects,
--  - and whether avg salary > 110k
WITH dept_sales AS (
  SELECT d.id AS dept_id, SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
