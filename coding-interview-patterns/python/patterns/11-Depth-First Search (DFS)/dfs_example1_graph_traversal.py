"""Example 1: DFS Traversal on a Graph (Adjacency List)
Goal:
- Perform a DFS traversal starting from a given node and print the visit order.
Key ideas:
- Use recursion to go deep (depth-first) along neighbors.
- Maintain a 'visited' set to avoid revisiting nodes / infinite loops.
- This works for directed or undirected graphs; we assume undirected here.
