Greedy Algorithms Bundle
========================
Includes five classic greedy problems:
1) Merge Intervals — merge by start
2) Erase Overlap Intervals — choose non-overlapping by earliest finish
3) Minimum Arrows to Burst Balloons — choose ends greedily
4) Jump Game I — farthest reach
5) Partition Labels — cut at last occurrences

Usage:
  python greedy_algorithms_all_examples.py

Or run individually:
  python greedy_example1_merge_intervals.py
  python greedy_example2_erase_overlap.py
  python greedy_example3_min_arrows.py
  python greedy_example4_jump_game.py
  python greedy_example5_partition_labels.py
