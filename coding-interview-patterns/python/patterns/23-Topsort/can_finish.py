"""
Can Finish (Course Schedule) â€” Cycle Detection via Kahn's Algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Given n courses labeled 0..n-1 and a list of prerequisite edges (u, v) meaning
u -> v (take u before v), determine if all courses can be finished.

Technique (Kahn's Algorithm):
- Build adjacency list and indegree array.
- Initialize a queue with all nodes of indegree 0.
- Repeatedly pop from the queue, decrement indegrees of neighbors, and push new zeros.
- If we process all nodes, the graph is acyclic; otherwise, a cycle exists.

Complexity:
- O(n + m) time, where m = number of edges.
- O(n + m) space for graph, indegrees, and queue.

Run:
    python can_finish.py
