# Two Sum

# Idea:
# Scan once while storing each numberâ€™s index in a hash map. For each num, check if target - num is already in the map.

# Algorithm (One Pass)

# Initialize empty map pos = {} mapping value -> index.

# For each index i and value num:

# need = target - num

# If need is in pos, return [pos[need], i].

# Otherwise store pos[num] = i.

# If no pair found, return [-1, -1] (or raise).

# Complexity:
# Time O(n), Space O(n)

        target (int): Desired sum.

    Returns:
        List[int]: Indices [i, j] with nums[i] + nums[j] == target, or [-1, -1] if none.
