# Matrix Algorithms in LeetCode üß©

## Introduction üìù

In algorithms, **Matrix** refers to a two-dimensional array, often used to solve problems related to grids, image manipulation, or other grid-based data structures. Matrix problems on LeetCode vary widely, from basic operations like rotating matrices to more complex challenges like searching, optimization, or traversing cells in the matrix.

## 1. Rotate Matrix

- **Description**: Rotate a square `n x n` matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**:
    ```
    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    [
      [7, 4, 1],
      [8, 5, 2],
      [9, 6, 3]
    ]
    ```

## 2. Set Matrix Zeroes

- **Description**: If an element in the matrix is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**:
    ```
    [
      [1, 1, 1],
      [1, 0, 1],
      [1, 1, 1]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    [
      [1, 0, 1],
      [0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 1]
    ]
    ```

## 3. Game of Life

- **Description**: Apply the Game of Life rules to update the state of the cells in the matrix.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**:
    ```
    [
      [0, 1, 0],
      [0, 0, 1],
      [1, 1, 1],
      [0, 0, 0]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    [
      [0, 0, 0],
      [1, 0, 1],
      [0, 1, 1],
      [0, 1, 0]
    ]
    ```

## 4. Spiral Matrix

- **Description**: Return the elements of a matrix in a spiral order.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**:
    ```
    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
    ```

## 5. Diagonal Traverse

- **Description**: Traverse the matrix diagonally.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**:
    ```
    [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    [1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9]
    ```

## Common Approaches to Solve Matrix Problems üí°

### 1. **In-place Operations**

- **Explanation**: This approach modifies the matrix directly without using extra space. It‚Äôs ideal for problems like rotating a matrix or setting entire rows and columns to zero.
- **Example**: Rotating a matrix or setting rows and columns to zero.

### 2. **Traversal**

- **Explanation**: Matrix problems often require traversing through each element in the matrix, either by row, column, or even diagonally.
- **Example**: Traversing the matrix in spiral order or diagonally.

### 3. **Search Algorithms**

- **Explanation**: For problems involving searching for an element or path within a matrix, search algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) are useful.
- **Example**: Searching for the shortest path in a matrix.

### 4. **Dynamic Programming**

- **Explanation**: Dynamic programming is useful for optimization problems in matrices, such as finding the longest sequence or the most optimal path.
- **Example**: Finding the longest increasing path in a matrix.

### 5. **Space Optimization**

- **Explanation**: Some problems require memory optimization, especially when dealing with large matrices. You can sometimes modify the matrix directly to save space rather than creating new matrices.
- **Example**: Using a matrix for dynamic programming solutions without additional space.
