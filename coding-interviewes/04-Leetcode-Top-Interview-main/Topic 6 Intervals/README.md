# Topic 6 Intervals

## ðŸ›  Overview

**Intervals** problems on LeetCode involve working with ranges of values, typically represented as pairs of numbers `[start, end]`. These problems often require operations like merging, inserting, or determining overlaps between intervals. Understanding these problems is crucial for mastering algorithmic concepts in sorting, greedy algorithms, and binary search.

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Operations on Intervals

- **Merging Overlapping Intervals**
- **Inserting Intervals**
- **Checking Overlap**
- **Counting Non-Overlapping Intervals**

## ðŸ§  Tips and Tricks

1. **Sorting is Key:**

   - Many interval problems require sorting by the start (or end) of intervals. Sorting simplifies comparisons and merging.

2. **Greedy Algorithms Work Well:**

   - Problems involving overlapping intervals often use a greedy approach, focusing on choosing the "best" interval at each step.

3. **Edge Cases to Watch For:**

   - Empty interval lists.
   - Single intervals.
   - Completely overlapping intervals, e.g., `[1, 10]` and `[2, 5]`.
   - Non-overlapping intervals, e.g., `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]`.

4. **Understand the Mathematical Overlap Condition:**
   - Two intervals overlap if `max(start1, start2) <= min(end1, end2)`.
