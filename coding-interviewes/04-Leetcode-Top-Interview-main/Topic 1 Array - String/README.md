## üìå Fundamental in Algorithmic Problem Solving Array & String

### 1. **Basic Array & String processing** üìñ

Arrays and strings are basic data structures where arrays hold a collection of elements, and strings represent sequences of characters. Many algorithmic problems involve processing these structures, such as searching, sorting, and finding optimal subsets or sequences.

### 3. **Greedy** üçÄ

Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each stage, with the hope of finding a global optimum. This technique is used in problems where choosing the best local solution leads to the best overall outcome.

### 6. **Hash Table** üóÇ

A hash table is a data structure that allows for fast access to data via key-value pairs. It is used to store data for quick lookup, insertion, and deletion. Hash tables are particularly useful for problems like finding duplicates or counting occurrences.

### 8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)** üîÑ

Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the results to avoid redundant work. It is widely used in optimization problems.
