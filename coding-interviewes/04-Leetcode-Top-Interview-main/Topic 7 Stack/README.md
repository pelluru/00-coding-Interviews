# Topic 7 Stack

## 🧑‍💻 Introduction to Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Think of it like a stack of plates 🍽️ — you always add new plates on top and take the top one off first.

Stacks are powerful tools used to solve a variety of problems efficiently. They’re like a magic box 🧙‍♂️ for handling nested structures, evaluating expressions, and keeping track of previous elements in many algorithms.

### ⚡ Key Operations of a Stack

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack 🆙
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack 🔽
- **Peek** or **Top**: Look at the top element without removing it 👀
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty 🚫
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the stack 📏

### 💡 Where are Stacks Used?

Stacks are commonly used in scenarios like:

- **Expression evaluation** (e.g., arithmetic expressions, reverse Polish notation) ➗
- **Parsing and backtracking** (e.g., balanced parentheses) 🧩
- **Depth-first search (DFS)** in graph traversal 🌲

They can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and many algorithms rely on stack-based operations to solve problems effectively.
