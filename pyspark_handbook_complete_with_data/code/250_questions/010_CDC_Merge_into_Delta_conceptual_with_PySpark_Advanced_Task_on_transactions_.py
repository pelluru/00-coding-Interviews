Question 10: CDC/Merge into Delta (conceptual with PySpark): Advanced Task on `transactions`

Pure PySpark solution scaffold with detailed comments.
Auto-extracted from the handbook. Replace placeholders and adjust inputs.

Best Practices Notes:
- Prefer built-in SQL functions over Python UDFs for performance.
- Use AQE (`spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true`) to mitigate skew and auto-optimize joins.
- For streaming, always define watermarks and deterministic sinks (foreachBatch + MERGE).
- Validate with pytest + chispa; profile tasks/skew in the Spark UI.
